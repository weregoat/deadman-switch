# deadman-switch
In case something happens to me I need to alert someone to take care of my rabbits

# Idea
A basic dead-man switch app to run on my phone.
* A reasonable timer (a few hours). I just need to alert someone that she may need to organize for the bunnies. Not meant to save my life.
* Off at night time.
* Using also accelerometer would be good if I can keep the polling to a minimum, but just button would do fine for a start. 
* Countdown should keep going while the phone sleeps, but should be reset by any activity (if I can wake up the phone, then I should also be able to look after Boo and Buster)
* Keep an eye on battery usage.
* Have one or two acousting warnings before sending out SMSs...
* Keep it simple (don't try to build a general library, don't try to write it in Rust or Lisp). 
* It does not need to be bomb-proof. Remember the scenario: you die and someone has to take care of the rabbits before they starve or run out of water. Don't try to solve freak cases regardless of how interesting they might be.
* Also don't try to solve everything by an app. Make sure the rabbits have always access to plenty to eat and drink in case the app fails.
