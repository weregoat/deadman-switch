# deadman-switch
In case something happens to me I need to alert someone to take care of my rabbits

# Idea
A basic dead-man switch app to run on my phone.
* A reasonable timer (a few hours). I just need to alert people that may need to organize for the bunnies. Not meant to save my life.
* Off at night time.
* Using also accelerometer would be good if I can keep the polling to a minimum, but just button would do fine for a start. 
* Countdown should keep going while phone sleep, but should be reset by any activity (if I can wake up the phone, then I should also be able to look after Boo and Buster)
* Keep an eye on battery usage
* Have one or two acousting warnings before sending out SMSs...
* Keep it simple (don't try to build a general library, don't try write it in Rust or Lisp).
